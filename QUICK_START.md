# KNX-RS Quick Start Guide

**5-Minute Setup for Hardware Testing** ‚ö°

---

## Step 1: Configure (2 minutes)

Edit `src/configuration.rs`:

```rust
pub const CONFIG: &str = r#"
WIFI_NETWORK=YourActualWiFiName
WIFI_PASSWORD=YourActualPassword
KNX_GATEWAY_IP=192.168.1.50
"#;
```

üí° **Tips:**
- WiFi must be 2.4 GHz (Pico 2 W doesn't support 5 GHz)
- SSID and password are case-sensitive
- Gateway IP should be on same network

---

## Step 2: Flash (3 minutes)

### Automatic Method (Recommended)

```bash
./flash.sh
```

Follow the prompts to build and flash.

### Manual Method

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release --target thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf --features embassy-rp

# Flash with probe-rs
probe-rs run --chip RP2350 target/thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf/release/knx-rs

# OR convert to UF2 for drag-and-drop
elf2uf2-rs target/thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf/release/knx-rs knx-rs.uf2
# Then: Hold BOOTSEL, connect USB, copy knx-rs.uf2 to drive
```

---

## Step 3: Monitor

### With probe-rs (Real-Time)

```bash
probe-rs attach --chip RP2350
```

### With USB Serial

```bash
# macOS/Linux
screen /dev/tty.usbmodem* 115200

# Windows
# Use PuTTY or TeraTerm
```

---

## Expected Output

```
Random seed: 123456789
Connecting to WiFi network: YourWiFi
WiFi connected successfully!
IP Address: 192.168.1.100
KNX Gateway configured: 192.168.1.50
‚úì Connected to KNX gateway!
Sending test: bool=true to 1/2/3
‚úì Command sent successfully
Listening for KNX bus events...
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå WiFi won't connect
- Check SSID spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify it's 2.4 GHz network
- Try moving Pico closer to router

### ‚ùå KNX connection fails
- Ping gateway: `ping 192.168.1.50`
- Check port 3671 open
- Verify same network/VLAN

### ‚ùå No output visible
- Check USB cable supports data (not charge-only)
- Try different USB port
- Check RTT connection with probe-rs

---

## Test Commands

Once running, trigger KNX events and watch the log:

```
üí° Switch 1/2/3: ON          # Someone turned on a light
üå°Ô∏è  Temperature 5/1/10: 21.5¬∞C # Temperature sensor update
üí° Lux 1/2/4: 500.0 lx       # Light level sensor
```
