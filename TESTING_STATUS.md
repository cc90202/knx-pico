# Testing Status

Current status of the automated testing infrastructure.

## ✅ Working

### Unit Tests
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational
- **Coverage**: 178 tests
- **Command**: `make test-unit` or `python3 test_runner.py --unit-only`
- **What**: Tests all library functions without I/O

### Example Verification
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational
- **Command**: `make test-examples` or `python3 test_runner.py --examples-only`
- **What**: Verifies that all examples compile for both USB and defmt configurations
- **Examples tested**:
  - `knx_sniffer` with `embassy-rp-usb`
  - `knx_sniffer` with `embassy-rp`

### KNX Simulator
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational
- **Features**:
  - Complete KNXnet/IP protocol implementation
  - CONNECT/DISCONNECT/TUNNELING/HEARTBEAT/SEARCH support
  - Verbose logging
  - Auto-start/stop in test runner

### CI/CD Workflows
- **Status**: ✅ Configured
- **Files**:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous integration
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Automated releases
- **Note**: May need adjustments based on integration test status

### Automation Tools
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational
- **test_runner.py**: Orchestrates all tests with simulator management
- **Makefile**: Provides convenient shortcuts
- **check-all.sh**: Verifies all build configurations

## ⚠️ Temporarily Disabled

### Integration Tests
- **Status**: ⚠️ Temporarily disabled
- **Reason**: Project structure has both binary and library code in `src/`
- **Issue**: Integration tests cannot compile because they try to include binary-only modules (`main.rs`, `knx_client.rs`, etc.) that require embassy features

#### Why This Happens

The project has:
```
src/
├── lib.rs              # Library (no_std, published to crates.io)
├── main.rs             # Binary (embassy-rp, not published)
├── knx_client.rs       # Binary-only module
├── knx_discovery.rs    # Binary-only module
└── configuration.rs    # Binary-only module
```

When running `cargo test --test integration_test`, Cargo tries to compile ALL files in `src/`, including binary-specific code that requires embassy features.

#### Possible Solutions

1. **Move binary code to `bin/` directory** (recommended)
   ```
   src/lib.rs              # Library only
   bin/knx-rs/
   ├── main.rs
   ├── knx_client.rs
   ├── knx_discovery.rs
   └── configuration.rs
   ```

2. **Use feature-gated modules more carefully**
   - Add `#[cfg(feature = "embassy-rp")]` to binary modules
   - May be complex to maintain

3. **Create separate integration test workspace**
   - Separate `integration-tests/` crate
   - More complex project structure

## 📊 Test Coverage Summary

| Test Type | Status | Count | Command |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Unit Tests** | ✅ Pass | 178 | `make test-unit` |
| **Integration Tests** | ⚠️ Disabled | N/A | (see above) |
| **Example Compilation** | ✅ Pass | 2 | `make test-examples` |
| **Embedded Compilation** | ✅ Pass | 4 configs | `./check-all.sh` |

## 🎯 What This Means for Publishing

**Good news**: The library can still be safely published to crates.io!

**Why**:
1. ✅ All **library** code is thoroughly tested (178 unit tests)
2. ✅ Examples compile for target hardware (RP2040)
3. ✅ All build configurations verified
4. ✅ Documentation builds without errors
5. ⚠️ Integration tests are nice-to-have, but not required for library correctness

**What's tested**:
- Protocol parsing and generation
- Address handling
- DPT encoding/decoding
- Typestate tunnel client
- All public API

**What's NOT tested automatically**:
- End-to-end protocol flow with simulator (can be done manually)
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing (requires physical setup)

## 🔧 Manual Testing

Until integration tests are re-enabled, manual testing is recommended:

### With Simulator

```bash
# Terminal 1
python3 knx_simulator.py --verbose

# Terminal 2
cargo flash-sniffer-usb-release
# Connect serial monitor and observe
```

### With Physical Hardware

```bash
# Flash to Pico 2 W
cargo flash-sniffer-usb-release

# Observe KNX communication
screen /dev/tty.usbmodem* 115200
```

## 📋 Pre-Publish Checklist

Even with integration tests disabled, you can safely publish by verifying:

- [ ] All unit tests pass (`make test-unit`)
- [ ] All examples compile (`make test-examples`)
- [ ] All configurations build (`./check-all.sh`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`cargo fmt --check`)
- [ ] No clippy warnings (`cargo clippy`)
- [ ] Documentation builds (`make docs`)
- [ ] Manual testing with simulator or hardware successful

Run the full automated suite:
```bash
make pre-publish
```

## 🚀 Future Work

Priority tasks to improve testing:

1. **High**: Restructure project to separate bin/lib code
   - Enables proper integration tests
   - Cleaner separation of concerns
   - Better for crates.io consumers

2. **Medium**: Re-enable integration tests
   - After code restructuring
   - Verify with simulator

3. **Low**: Hardware-in-the-loop CI
   - Requires dedicated hardware
   - Nice for comprehensive testing
